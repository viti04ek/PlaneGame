Meso-Industrial Age WW1 Set 01

The included Photoshop workfiles contain layers indicating the uv-mapping, so new diffuse maps with different colours can be easily created.

The models do not contain any animation tracks.

Version 2 (2023-01)
The initial models did not have a pivot point that aligned to Unity's default rotation. A second copy of these models with adjusted pivot points have been added to version 2 of this package. These models and prefabs have the suffix '_yup' added to object name.
